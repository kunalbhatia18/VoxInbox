echo "🛠️ FUNCTION EXECUTION FIX APPLIED"
echo "================================="
echo ""

echo "🚨 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "New count functions (count_unread_emails, get_email_counts) weren't properly"
echo "categorized in the function execution logic, causing them to fail silently."
echo ""

echo "✅ FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "1. Added count functions to 'no additional parameters' category"
echo "2. Added detailed function execution logging"
echo "3. Removed problematic response state management"
echo "4. Always request voice response after function execution"
echo ""

echo "🔧 DEBUGGING ENHANCED:"
echo "Now shows: '🔧 Function call detected: count_unread_emails with args: {}'"
echo "And: '📤 Sent function result to OpenAI: {\"count\": 3, \"exact_count\": true}...'"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TEST NOW:"
echo "1. Restart your servers"
echo "2. Ask: 'How many unread emails do I have?'"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED BACKEND LOGS:"
echo "🔧 Function call detected: count_unread_emails with args: {}"
echo "🔧 Executing Gmail function: count_unread_emails"
echo "📤 Sent function result to OpenAI: {\"count\": 3, \"exact_count\": true}..."
echo "🎤 Requested voice response for function result"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED FRONTEND:"
echo "🚀 OpenAI response started"
echo "🔊 AI started speaking"
echo "Audio: 'You have exactly 3 unread emails.'"
echo "🔊 AI finished speaking"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Function calls should now work with proper audio responses!"
