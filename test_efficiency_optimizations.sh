echo "🎯 OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:"
echo "================================"
echo "✅ Audio sample rate: 24kHz → 16kHz (-33% bandwidth)"
echo "✅ Token limits: 100-800 → 25-200 tokens (-75% cost)" 
echo "✅ VAD threshold: 0.8 → 0.9 (fewer false triggers)"
echo "✅ Response time: Faster padding (300ms → 200ms)"
echo "✅ Temperature: 0.6 → 0.3 (more focused responses)"
echo "✅ Global token limit: 500 → 150 (-70%)"

echo ""
echo "💰 EXPECTED COST SAVINGS:"
echo "========================="
echo "• Audio bandwidth: -33%"
echo "• Token usage: -75%"  
echo "• Overall cost: -60-70%"
echo "• Response latency: -15-25%"

echo ""
echo "🧪 OPTIMIZATION TEST SCENARIOS:"
echo "==============================="

echo ""
echo "1️⃣ SHORT RESPONSE TEST (25 tokens max):"
echo "   Say: 'How many unread emails do I have?'"
echo "   Expected: '7 unread emails' (3-5 words only)"
echo "   Monitor: Look for '💬 Using 25 token limit'"

echo ""
echo "2️⃣ MEDIUM RESPONSE TEST (75 tokens max):"  
echo "   Say: 'List my recent emails'"
echo "   Expected: One sentence with key email subjects"
echo "   Monitor: Look for '💬 Using 75 token limit'"

echo ""
echo "3️⃣ AUDIO QUALITY TEST (16kHz):"
echo "   Say: 'Read me my most important email'"
echo "   Expected: Clear audio quality (should sound good despite lower sample rate)"
echo "   Monitor: Audio should be slightly smaller in logs"

echo ""
echo "4️⃣ SPEED TEST (Optimized VAD):"
echo "   Say: 'Help me' (short phrase)"
echo "   Expected: Faster response due to VAD optimizations"
echo "   Monitor: Response should feel snappier"

echo ""
echo "5️⃣ LONG RESPONSE TEST (200 tokens max):"
echo "   Say: 'Summarize my inbox situation'"
echo "   Expected: Two sentences maximum with essential info"
echo "   Monitor: Look for '💬 Using 200 token limit'"

echo ""
echo "🔍 WHAT TO MONITOR:"
echo "=================="

echo ""
echo "BACKEND LOGS (Success Indicators):"
echo "✅ '💬 Using 25 token limit for count_unread_emails' (was 100)" 
echo "✅ '💬 Using 75 token limit for search_messages' (was 300)"
echo "✅ '💬 Using 200 token limit for categorize_unread' (was 800)"
echo "✅ Faster audio chunk processing"

echo ""
echo "FRONTEND CONSOLE (Audio Optimization):"
echo "✅ '🎤 Processed [samples] → [smaller base64]' (should be ~33% smaller)"
echo "✅ Faster audio completion times"
echo "✅ No quality degradation in audio playback"

echo ""
echo "COST DASHBOARD (If Available):"
echo "✅ Token usage should drop by 60-75%"
echo "✅ Audio processing costs should drop by ~33%"
echo "✅ Overall API costs should be 60-70% lower"

echo ""
echo "❌ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO WATCH:"
echo "============================"
echo "• Audio quality too low (unlikely with 16kHz)"
echo "• Responses too short (adjust token limits if needed)" 
echo "• VAD too sensitive (increase threshold if needed)"
echo "• Response cutoffs (monitor completion logs)"

echo ""
echo "🎛️ FINE-TUNING OPTIONS:"
echo "======================="
echo "If responses are TOO short, you can adjust:"
echo "• Short functions: 25 → 40 tokens"
echo "• Medium functions: 75 → 100 tokens" 
echo "• Long functions: 200 → 300 tokens"
echo ""
echo "If VAD is too sensitive:"
echo "• Increase threshold: 0.9 → 0.95"
echo ""
echo "If audio quality issues:"
echo "• Revert sample rate: 16kHz → 20kHz (compromise)"

echo ""
echo "📈 SUCCESS METRICS:"
echo "=================="
echo "✅ 60-70% cost reduction in OpenAI usage"
echo "✅ 15-25% faster response times"
echo "✅ 33% less audio bandwidth usage"
echo "✅ Same or better voice quality"
echo "✅ More focused, concise responses"

echo "The system should now be significantly more cost-efficient"
echo "while maintaining excellent performance! 🎉"
