echo "🔧 FINAL AUDIO & ACCURACY FIXES"
echo "==============================="
echo ""

echo "✅ ISSUES ADDRESSED:"
echo "1. Multiple overlapping AI responses causing audio noise"
echo "2. AI hallucination (saying 201 emails instead of 3)"
echo "3. Audio interruption and stopping mid-response"
echo ""

echo "🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "• Added response state tracking to prevent overlap"
echo "• Enhanced AI instructions for numerical accuracy"
echo "• Improved voice activity detection sensitivity"
echo "• Added response deduplication logic"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "• Single clean AI response per user input"
echo "• Accurate email counts (no more hallucination)"
echo "• No more audio interruption or stopping"
echo "• Cleaner console logs"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TEST PROCEDURE:"
echo "1. Restart your app (kill current servers)"
echo "2. Ask: 'How many unread emails do I have?'"
echo "3. Expected: Single response with correct count"
echo "4. No more overlapping or interrupted audio"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:"
echo "✓ Only ONE '🚀 OpenAI response started' per question"
echo "✓ Only ONE '🔊 AI started speaking' per question"  
echo "✓ Correct email count (should match the 3 you actually have)"
echo "✓ Complete, uninterrupted audio response"
echo ""

echo "▶️ Ready to test the final fixes!"
