echo "üöÄ VoiceInbox AUDIO CUTOFF FIXES - Test Script"
echo "============================================="

echo ""
echo "üéØ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "‚úÖ REMOVED overlapping responses (was creating 2-3 responses per input)"
echo "‚úÖ INCREASED token limits: 150 ‚Üí 800 tokens (can finish sentences!)"
echo "‚úÖ IMPROVED instructions: 'Give complete responses, don't cut off'"
echo "‚úÖ BALANCED voice detection settings for complete responses"

echo ""
echo "üß™ TESTING SCENARIOS:"

echo ""
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ SIMPLE COUNT TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Say: 'How many unread emails do I have?'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ EXPECTED: Complete response like 'You have 7 unread emails'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ BEFORE: Would cut off mid-sentence"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ AFTER: Should give full response"

echo ""
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ LONGER RESPONSE TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Say: 'Can you tell me about my most important emails?'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ EXPECTED: Full explanation without cutting off"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ BEFORE: Would say 'Would you...' and stop"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ AFTER: Should complete the entire response"

echo ""
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ BUTTON STATE TEST:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ All tests should show: Blue ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Blue"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ EXPECTED: Button ALWAYS returns to blue"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Purple button stuck issue should be resolved"

echo ""
echo "üîç WHAT TO WATCH FOR:"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Only 1 'response.created' per user input (not 2-3)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Complete audio responses (no mid-sentence cutoffs)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Button returns to blue after each response"
echo "‚Ä¢ Backend logs: '‚úÖ Function completed - letting OpenAI continue'"

echo ""
echo "‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Multiple 'response.created' messages (means overlapping responses)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Audio cutting off mid-sentence"
echo "‚Ä¢ Button stuck purple"
echo "‚Ä¢ Backend logs showing token limit errors"

echo ""
echo "üìä EXPECTED LOG CHANGES:"

echo ""
echo "BEFORE (BAD):"
echo "response.created (1st)"
echo "response.done (1st ends)"
echo "response.created (2nd) ‚Üê OVERLAP CAUSING CUTOFF"
echo "response.done (2nd ends)"
echo "üö® Force completing audio playback after retries"

echo ""
echo "AFTER (GOOD):"
echo "response.created (only one)"
echo "‚úÖ Function completed - letting OpenAI continue"
echo "response.audio.done"
echo "response.done"
echo "üîä AI finished speaking"

echo ""
echo "üéØ COST IMPACT:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Token usage will increase (150‚Üí800 tokens)"
echo "‚Ä¢ BUT responses won't be cut off and re-tried"
echo "‚Ä¢ Overall better user experience vs cost tradeoff"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ Ready to test! The audio cutoff nightmare should be OVER!"
echo "Go to http://localhost:5173 and try the test scenarios above."
