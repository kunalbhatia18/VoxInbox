# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start - Test Your Latency Fixes

## Run the Test

```bash
# Make script executable and run tests
chmod +x run_latency_tests.sh
./run_latency_tests.sh
```

## Expected Results

**Before fixes**: 3-4 second delays, overlapping requests, errors
**After fixes**: <1 second responses, no conflicts, smooth operation

## Test Commands

1. **"How many unread emails do I have?"** - Should respond in <1 second
2. **"List my recent emails"** - Should give ultra-brief response
3. **Try speaking twice quickly** - Second attempt should be blocked

## Success Metrics

âœ… **Button States**: Blue â†’ Yellow (processing) â†’ Purple (speaking) â†’ Blue (ready)  
âœ… **Total Time**: <1 second for simple queries  
âœ… **No Errors**: Zero concurrent request conflicts  
âœ… **Brief Responses**: 1 sentence maximum (20 tokens)  

## Logs to Watch

**Good Signs**:
- `âš¡ ULTRA-SPEED: Immediate 20-token response created`
- `âš¡ TOTAL LATENCY: XXXms (target: <250ms)`
- `âœ“ Full response cycle complete - ready for new requests`

**Bad Signs** (should be gone):
- Multiple `response.created` in a row
- `conversation_already_has_active_response` errors
- `status: 'cancelled'` responses

Your voice assistant should now be **lightning fast**! âš¡
